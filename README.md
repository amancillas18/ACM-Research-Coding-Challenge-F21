Please follow the below instructions on how to submit your answers.

1.  Create a  **public**  fork of this repo and name it  `ACM-Research-Coding-Challenge-F21`. To fork this repo, click the button on the top right and click the "Fork" button.

2.  Clone the fork of the repo to your computer using  `git clone [the URL of your clone]`. You may need to install Git for this (Google it).

3.  Complete the Challenge based on the instructions below.

4.  Submit your solution by filling out this [form](https://acmutd.typeform.com/to/zF1IcBGR).

## Assessment Criteria 

Submissions will be evaluated holistically and based on a combination of effort, validity of approach, analysis, adherence to the prompt, use of outside resources (encouraged), promptness of your submission, and other factors. Your approach and explanation (detailed below) is the most weighted criteria, and partial solutions are accepted. 

## [](https://github.com/ACM-Research/Coding-Challenge-S21#question-one)Question One

[Sentiment analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis) is a natural language processing technique that computes a sentiment score for a body of text. This sentiment score can quantify how positive, negative, or neutral the text is. The following dataset in  `input.txt`  contains a relatively large body of text.

**Determine an overall sentiment score of the text in this file, explain what this score means, and contrast this score with what you expected.**  If your solution also provides different metrics about the text (magnitude, individual sentence score, etc.), feel free to add it to your explanation.   

**You may use any programming language you feel most comfortable. We recommend Python because it is the easiest to implement. You're allowed to use any library/API you want to implement this**, just document which ones you used in this README file. Try to complete this as soon as possible as submissions are evaluated on a rolling basis.

Regardless if you can or cannot answer the question, provide a short explanation of how you got your solution or how you think it can be solved in your README.md file. However, we highly recommend giving the challenge a try, you just might learn something new!

## Solution Explanation

To use sentiment analysis, we must implement the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library. NLTK has a built-in feature known as VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner). VADER is best suited for language used in social media and short sentences with abbreviations and slang. VADER is not as accurate when dealing with long paragraphs but it can be a good start to solve the problem. To implement VADER, we have to create an instance of `nltk.sentiment.SentimentIntensityAnalyzer`, then use `.polarity_scores()` on a raw string which can be done like this:

```
from nltk.sentiment import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer
sia = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()
sia.polarity_scores("Wow, NLTK is really powerful!")
```

We will obtain a variety of scores. The negative, neutral, and positive scores are related in which they all add up to 1 and cannot be negative. The compound score is calculated differently. It is not an average, and it can range from -1 to 1. Since VADER is not as accurate when dealing with long paragraphs, you have to set up VADER to analyze individual sentences instead of the whole block of text.

Another method you can use is Google's Cloud Natural Language API. To analyze sentiment in a document, a `POST` request has to be made to the `documents:analyzeSentiment` REST method and provide the appropriate request body shown below

```from google.cloud import language_v1

def sample_analyze_sentiment(text_content):
    """
    Analyzing Sentiment in a String

    Args:
      text_content The text content to analyze
    """

    client = language_v1.LanguageServiceClient()

    # text_content = 'I am so happy and joyful.'

    # Available types: PLAIN_TEXT, HTML
    type_ = language_v1.Document.Type.PLAIN_TEXT

    # Optional. If not specified, the language is automatically detected.
    # For list of supported languages:
    # https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/docs/languages
    language = "en"
    document = {"content": text_content, "type_": type_, "language": language}

    # Available values: NONE, UTF8, UTF16, UTF32
    encoding_type = language_v1.EncodingType.UTF8

    response = client.analyze_sentiment(request = {'document': document, 'encoding_type': encoding_type})
    # Get overall sentiment of the input document
    print(u"Document sentiment score: {}".format(response.document_sentiment.score))
    print(
        u"Document sentiment magnitude: {}".format(
            response.document_sentiment.magnitude
        )
    )
    # Get sentiment for all sentences in the document
    for sentence in response.sentences:
        print(u"Sentence text: {}".format(sentence.text.content))
        print(u"Sentence sentiment score: {}".format(sentence.sentiment.score))
        print(u"Sentence sentiment magnitude: {}".format(sentence.sentiment.magnitude))

    # Get the language of the text, which will be the same as
    # the language specified in the request or, if not specified,
    # the automatically-detected language.
    print(u"Language of the text: {}".format(response.language))

```
The Natural Language API can perform sentiment analysis directly on a file located in Cloud Storage, without the need to send the contents of the file in the body of your request. Below is an example of performing sentiment analysis on a Cloud Storage file

```
from google.cloud import language_v1

def sample_analyze_sentiment(gcs_content_uri):
    """
    Analyzing Sentiment in text file stored in Cloud Storage

    Args:
      gcs_content_uri Google Cloud Storage URI where the file content is located.
      e.g. gs://[Your Bucket]/[Path to File]
    """

    client = language_v1.LanguageServiceClient()

    # gcs_content_uri = 'gs://cloud-samples-data/language/sentiment-positive.txt'

    # Available types: PLAIN_TEXT, HTML
    type_ = language_v1.Document.Type.PLAIN_TEXT

    # Optional. If not specified, the language is automatically detected.
    # For list of supported languages:
    # https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/docs/languages
    language = "en"
    document = {"gcs_content_uri": gcs_content_uri, "type_": type_, "language": language}

    # Available values: NONE, UTF8, UTF16, UTF32
    encoding_type = language_v1.EncodingType.UTF8

    response = client.analyze_sentiment(request = {'document': document, 'encoding_type': encoding_type})
    # Get overall sentiment of the input document
    print(u"Document sentiment score: {}".format(response.document_sentiment.score))
    print(
        u"Document sentiment magnitude: {}".format(
            response.document_sentiment.magnitude
        )
    )
    # Get sentiment for all sentences in the document
    for sentence in response.sentences:
        print(u"Sentence text: {}".format(sentence.text.content))
        print(u"Sentence sentiment score: {}".format(sentence.sentiment.score))
        print(u"Sentence sentiment magnitude: {}".format(sentence.sentiment.magnitude))

    # Get the language of the text, which will be the same as
    # the language specified in the request or, if not specified,
    # the automatically-detected language.
    print(u"Language of the text: {}".format(response.language))

```
